# Welcome to the Therapeutic Caribou

[Glitch](https://glitch.com) assigns random, auto-generated names whenever you remix a project (something along the lines of _adjective_-_verb_). This project is the result of a fun idea: what if you had one evening to create a new app based entirely on its auto-generated name?

## What is Glitch?

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

## What Is This Project About?

The name of this project got me thinking about the [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/) Python library that I was playing with the other day. The [`wink-sentiment`](http://winkjs.org/wink-sentiment/) library that I'm using in its place isn't quite the same, but it does a pretty good job of performing sentiment analysis on text it receives.

I also got to thinking about the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) exercise I was working on earlier, using native [SpeechRecognition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) features.

Why not tie the two together for a heart-to-heart with one of Canada's most-beloved critters?

## To-Do

As this was something thrown together pretty haphazardly, it's in need of some love. Things to add include:

- Make the caribou a better conversationalist.
- Fix a bug where the SpeechRecognizer event stops firing if it's idle too long.
- Slap a coat of paint onto the front-end.
